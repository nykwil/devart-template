As part of trying to demonstrate a generic aproach to image analysis based genetic art generation.  I used opengl framebuffer to generate the images.  This allowed me to use and opengl drawing functions to generate each work.

Looking into semi transparent images had interesting results but aren't incorporated into the build.
